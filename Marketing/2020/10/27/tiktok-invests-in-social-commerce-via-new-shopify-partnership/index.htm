				<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is further investing in social commerce with today&#8217;s announcement of a new global partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify. The deal aims to make it easier for Shopify&#8217;s over 1 million merchants to reach TikTok&#8217;s younger audience and drive sales. The partnership will eventually expand to include other in-app shopping features, as well, the companies said.</p>
<p>At launch, the agreement allows Shopify merchants to create, run and optimize their TikTok marketing campaigns directly from the Shopify dashboard by installing the new TikTok channel app from the Shopify App Store. Once installed, merchants will have access to the key functions from the TikTok For Business Ads Manager at their disposal.</p>
<p>These ad tools allow merchants to create native, shareable content that turns their products into In-Feed video ads that will resonate with the TikTok community. Merchants will be able to target their audiences across gender, age, user behavior, and video category, and then track the campaign&#8217;s performance over time. The campaigns&#8217; costs will vary, based on the merchant&#8217;s own business objectives and how much they want to spend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a part of this effort, Shopify merchants can also install or connect their &#8220;TikTok Pixel&#8221; &#8212; a tool that helps them to more easily track conversions driven by their TikTok ad campaigns.</p>
<p>Currently, e-commerce merchants <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=94409979840183423">can track user actions like</a> a user browsing their page, a registration on a website, adding items to their cart, placing an order, and completing the payment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2065894" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2065894" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2065894" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="440" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2065894" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>Shopify tells TechCrunch a small number of merchants previously gained access to these features as part of a beta test. But as of today, Oct. 27, the product is being made available to all merchants across the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok is one of the world’s fastest growing entertainment platforms with over 100 million highly engaged users in the U.S. alone,&#8221; said Satish Kanwar, Vice President of Product at Shopify, in a statement about the new partnership. &#8220;The TikTok channel means Shopify merchants—even those without a strong TikTok following of their own yet—can connect with these new audiences using content that feels authentic and genuine to the TikTok experience,&#8221; Kanwar added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2065893" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2065893" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2065893" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="440" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2065893" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>To get started with the new features, merchants who want to advertise on TikTok will first install the TikTok channel app, then create and connect their TikTok For Business account and install the one-click pixel. They can then deploy In-Feed shoppable video ads by selecting the product they want to feature using ad templates specifically designed for commerce. Because these templates use existing imagery or videos, the TikTok channel can work for merchants of any size, Shopify notes.</p>
<p>To kick off the partnership, merchants are being offered a $300 ad credit to get started with their first TikTok campaign.</p>
<p>In addition, the two companies have partnered on their first co-branded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app/">Hashtag Challenge Plus</a> campaign, #ShopBlack, to celebrate Black-owned businesses. Shopify had earlier featured Black-owned businesses in its own app, Shop. But from Nov. 10 through Nov. 15, the TikTok community will be able to browse videos from over 40 Shopify merchants via the new hashtag and its accompanying branded effect within TikTok, too.</p>
<p>Shopify and TikTok had been working together to test various social commerce initiatives ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>The companies, for example, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-users-can-link-to-shopify-storefronts-with-ecommerce-buttons-2020-9">had been spotted trialing a new shopping button</a> that allowed TikTok creators to link their Shopify storefront from their videos. (Teespring was also testing this with TikTok). TikTok had offered <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=6723856280470945797">a TikTok Ads Pixel</a> for Shopify merchants before today, as well.  But the partnership makes the pixel integration a 1-click install, so merchants don&#8217;t have to manipulate code.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2065892" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2065892" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2065892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopifyxTikTok3.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="440" /><p id="caption-attachment-2065892" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to partner with Shopify and provide a channel for their merchants to reach new audiences and drive sales on TikTok,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, Vice President, Global Business Solutions at TikTok, in a statement. &#8220;As social commerce proliferates, retailers are recognizing that TikTok&#8217;s creative and highly engaged community sets it apart from other platforms. We&#8217;re constantly exploring new and innovative ways to connect brands with our users, and Shopify is the perfect partner to help us grow and expand our commerce capabilities globally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>TikTok and Shopify&#8217;s partnership won&#8217;t be limited to the new TikTok channel app, however. That&#8217;s just the first step.</p>
<p>We understand the deal will soon expand to other shopping features, too.</p>
<p>TikTok says it plans to start testing new in-app features that will make it easier for users to discover Shopify merchants and their products by expanding their reach through video and on their account profiles. These features will also &#8220;let users browse merchant&#8217;s products and shop directly through the TikTok app,&#8221; a spokesperson said. They didn&#8217;t offer specific details about the features or how the payments portion would work, saying that more information would be available when the new tools launched.</p>
<p>However, the features will launch to a limited beta group of testers soon, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed.</p>

<p>Shopify isn&#8217;t the first to recognize TikTok&#8217;s potential as a new type of social shopping platform. Its ability to drive merchant traffic and sales was a key reason for Walmart&#8217;s participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/tiktok-wtf/">the TikTok-Oracle deal</a> &#8212; a deal whose current status is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/tiktok-wtf/">still unknown,</a> of course, given the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-has-authority-to-ban-tiktok-government-lawyers-say-11603568499"> ongoing TikTok lawsuit</a> and the upcoming Presidential election whose outcome could impact the Trump Administration&#8217;s TikTok ban.</p>
<p>TikTok itself has been steadily ramping up its tools for merchants and other social shopping features. To date, it has  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/tiktok-link-bio-social-commerce/">experimented with allowing users to add e-commerce links </a>to their bios;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/levis-partnered-with-tiktok-on-social-commerce-and-doubled-its-product-views/"> launched &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; buttons</a> for brands&#8217; video ads; and introduced shoppable components to hashtags with the e-commerce feature (soon to be used for #ShopBlack), known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app/">Hashtag Challenge Plus</a>.</p>
<p>Shopify, meanwhile, has been working to deliver more tools <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shopifys-director-of-retail-helps-brick-and-mortar-retailers-thrive-2020-10?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Falleyinsider%2Fsilicon_alley_insider+%28Silicon+Alley+Insider%29">that give smaller businesses the ability to compete</a> against Walmart and Amazon, while at the same time<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/"> partnering with Walmart</a> to give its merchants broader reach.</p>
<p>The TikTok-Shopify partnership could help the video platform better compete against other sources of social commerce, including the growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526535/live-shopping-instagram-facebook-amazon-influencers?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">live stream shopping apps</a> as well as efforts from Facebook and its family of apps. The social giant has recently rolled out a bevy of shopping-focused updates across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/instagram-expands-shopping-on-igtv-plans-test-of-shopping-on-reels/">Instagram</a>, and &#8212; just last week &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/">WhatsApp,</a> with the goal of directing users to shop in its apps, then check out seamlessly with Facebook Pay.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s advantage is that it&#8217;s a video-based social network, more like YouTube, rather than a platform whose roots were in editorial-quality imagery, like Instagram. On Instagram, video features have been added in over time. Now, a number of Instagram products include video &#8212; like  Feed posts, Stories, Instagram Live, IGTV, and, finally, Instagram&#8217;s TikTok rival, Reels. But overall, the impact is that Instagram has started to feel overcrowded.</p>
<p>TikTok says the new TikTok channel for Shopify merchants is available today in the U.S. It will roll out to other markets next year, including elsewhere in North America, Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>

TechCrunch has also confirmed the discussions took place from a source familiar with the conversations.<\/p>\n<p>While the talks occurred over the past several months, they&#8217;re no longer taking place, though the reason they ended isn&#8217;t known according to the report. It&#8217;s also worth noting that just a few days ago, Bloomberg reported that Clubhouse was seeking to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of around $4 billion, but the report detailing the potential acquisition talks indicate that the discussions with Twitter collapsed first, leading to a change in strategy to pursue securing additional capital in exchange for equity investment.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has its own product very similar to Clubhouse \u2014 Spaces, a drop-in audio chatroom feature that it has been rolling out gradually to its user base over the past few months. Clubhouse, meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/05\/clubhouse-payments\/\">just launched the first of its monetization efforts, Clubhouse Payments,<\/a> which lets users send direct payments to other creators on the platform, provided that person has enabled receipt of said payments.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Interestingly, the monetization effort from Clubhouse actually doesn&#8217;t provide them with any money; instead, it&#8217;s monetization for recipient users who get 100% of the funds directed their way, minus a small cut for processing that goes directly to Stripe, the payment provider Clubhouse is using to enable the virtual tips.<\/p>\n<p>While we aren&#8217;t privy to the specifics of these talks between Twitter and Clubhouse, it does seem like an awfully high price tag for the social network to pay for the audio app, especially given its own progress with Spaces. Clubhouse&#8217;s early traction has been undeniable, but there are a lot of questions still remaining about its longevity, and it&#8217;s also being cloned left and right by other platforms, begging the age-old startup question of whether it&#8217;s a feature or a product on its own.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever went down, the timing of this revelation seems likely to prime the pump for Clubhouse&#8217;s conversation with potential investors at its target valuation for the round it&#8217;s looking to raise. Regardless, it&#8217;s exciting to have this kind of activity, buzz and attention paid to a consumer software play after many years of what one could argue has been a relatively lackluster period for the category.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HEw3vYhdYC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/23\/clubhouse-ux-teardown-a-closer-look-at-homepage-curation-follow-hooks-and-other-features\/\">Clubhouse UX teardown: A closer look at homepage curation, follow hooks and other features<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Clubhouse UX teardown: A closer look at homepage curation, follow hooks and other features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/23\/clubhouse-ux-teardown-a-closer-look-at-homepage-curation-follow-hooks-and-other-features\/embed\/#?secret=HEw3vYhdYC\" data-secret=\"HEw3vYhdYC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter held talks with Clubhouse around a potential acquisition of the live drop-in audio networking platform, with a deal value somewhere around $4 billion, according to a report from Bloomberg.

It improves a coach\u2019s line of sight and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of this tool can \u2014 and should \u2014 be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event.<\/p>\n<p>Omoigui explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skillset that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>The big picture<\/h2>\n<p>Before getting into the steps, it&#8217;s important to understand what the aim is. The upshot? For founders to have the best and most complete view of their company, team, investors, product and competitors.<\/p>\n<p>For founders, that means being able to zoom out and see each of their employees\u2019 points of view and being inclusive. Without an All-22 tape, founders can mistakenly spend too much on engineering while ignoring the product rollout strategy or forget to communicate with employees outside of their bubble of interest. A company can become fragmented as more blind spots emerge, which can ultimately lead to oversights that damage its reputation, operations or even its ability to raise money from investors.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For operators and investors, what we see is usually very driven by where we stand, or where we sit. And what you have to discover really is: How can I get much better views? And the best view is always the plan view, you&#8217;re looking from the top down, you&#8217;re watching the movement, and you have line of sight, you know, that&#8217;s essentially 360 degrees.

In December, Twitch<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses\/\"> released an updated set of rules<\/a> designed to take harassment and abuse more seriously, admitting that women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community were impacted by a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; amount of that toxic behavior on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch&#8217;s policies now include serious offenses that could pose a safety threat, even when they happen entirely away from the streaming service. Those threats include violent extremism, terrorism, threats of mass violence, sexual assault and ties to known hate groups.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company will also continue to evaluate off-platform behavior in cases that happen on Twitch, like an on-stream situation that leads to harassment on Twitter or Facebook.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"UAdcAuoydV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses\/\">Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses\/embed\/#?secret=UAdcAuoydV\" data-secret=\"UAdcAuoydV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;While this policy is new, we have taken action historically against serious, clear misconduct that took place off service, but until now, we didn\u2019t have an approach that scaled,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, adding that investigating off-platform behavior requires additional resources to address the complexity inherent in those cases.<\/p>\n<p>To handle reports for its broadened rules, Twitch created a dedicated email address (OSIT@twitch.tv) to handle reports about off-service behavior. The company says it has partnered with a third-party investigative law firm to vet the reports it receives.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch cites its<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric\/\"> actions against former President Donald Trump<\/a> as the most high-profile instance of off-platform behavior resulting in enforcement. The company disabled Trump&#8217;s account following the attack on the U.S. Capitol and later suspended him indefinitely, citing fears that he could use the service to incite violence.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to have a higher profile than the president, but Trump isn&#8217;t the only big time banned Twitch user.

The ride-hailing giant not only wants drivers to know that there\u2019s business to be had once again, but they also want to sweeten the deal with incentives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Wednesday, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/newsroom\/getting-drivers-back-on-the-road\/\">announced the launch of a $250 million driver stimulus<\/a> to welcome drivers back into the fold and recruit new ones as the pandemic begins to ease in the U.S. Both returning drivers and new drivers will be receiving bonuses over the coming months, according to an Uber spokesperson.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn 2020, many drivers stopped driving because they couldn\u2019t count on getting enough trips to make it worth their time,\u201d reads the blog post announcing the stimulus. \u201cIn 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them \u2014 making it a great time to be a driver.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to high rider demand and low supply of drivers, the current median hourly rate for cities like Philadelphia, Austin, Chicago, Miami and Phoenix is $26.66, which is 25% to 75% higher than they were in March of last year. Uber wants drivers to take advantage of the higher earnings now because \u201cthis is likely a temporary situation.\u201d Meaning as the country recovers and more gig workers get back behind the wheel, earnings will likely decrease from their current levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stimulus money will go on top of those hourly rates, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The incentive structure will be based on individual activity, as well as location. For example, in Austin, current drivers are guaranteed $1,100 if they complete 115 trips. In Phoenix, they can earn an extra $1,775 for 200 trips.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div>&#8220;We will have more guarantees coming in both those cities as well as all the other markets we are targeting in the U.S. &#8211; the dollar and trip amounts may just change slightly depending on local factors,&#8221; said the spokesperson.<\/div>\n<p>The money will also go toward guaranteed minimum pay and on-boarding for new Uber drivers, and t<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he full $250 million pool is coming directly from Uber\u2019s pockets.

It\u2019s a very patient-friendly product.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Companies that use the buy now, pay later model with zero interest or fees need to make revenue somehow, and in Walnut\u2019s case it is by charging healthcare providers a percentage of each sale or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If a provider\u2019s collection rate for an out-of-pocket is 50%, Walnut would go to them and say \u201cgive us a 40% discount, and we\u2019ll guarantee the cash for you upfront.\u201d The startup will take the risk, and then the provider is able to make 60% of the collection rate.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"r88OWk8juw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble\/\">Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC\/PE bubble<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC\/PE bubble&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble\/embed\/#?secret=r88OWk8juw\" data-secret=\"r88OWk8juw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Now, ideally, a provider would want to get 100% of payments they are owed, but that is wishful thinking. Patel explained that a large number of bills go unpaid due to bankruptcies or a default on payments (the average collections rate for hospitals out of pocket is less than 20%). Because of this, a company like Walnut has room to offer at least some stable upfront cash to hospitals, even if it ends up being 60% of overall bills versus 100%.<\/p>\n<p>The company uses \u201cextensive underwriting models\u201d to figure out if a patient should qualify for a loan. Patel says that the startup goes beyond using credit score, which he describes as an \u201coutdated metric\u201d, and instead looks at thousands of data points from different providers, from side hustle income to spending habits on things like groceries and bills.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1308296\" style=\"width: 734px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1308296\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-1308296\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"724\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg 3817w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=768,566 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=1536,1132 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=2048,1509 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1308296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shutterstock.com\/gallery-540784p1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lightspring <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a> \/ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shutterstock.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shutterstock <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Walnut\u2019s biggest challenge, says Patel, is to underwrite the population and pay the healthcare provider upfront in cash. It then collects from the patient on the back end, which comes with its own amount of risk.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo be able to take on that risk for patients that are less credit-worthy is a very challenging problem, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really solved yet in healthcare,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The startup is starting by working with small private practices of one to five physicians that focus on specialties like dentistry, dermatology and fertility.<\/p>\n<p>A big part of Walnut\u2019s success will be determined by if it can attract people that truly need flexible financing options. For example, the company doesn&#8217;t have any hospitals as a partner yet, which would tap a larger group of patients that likely need flexible financing options the most. Right now, \u201cthe people who get elective-care surgery are the ones that can afford it.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gIAGD8QkZM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/making-sense-of-klarna\/\">Making sense of Klarna<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/making-sense-of-klarna\/embed\/#?secret=gIAGD8QkZM\" data-secret=\"gIAGD8QkZM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But Patel doesn\u2019t see this as a disconnect; instead, he sees it as an opportunity to widen access to elective medical care to more people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI talked to a person last week who has no teeth and wants dentures but it costs $6,000,\u201d he said. \u201cThat person should be able to afford it, and we enabled them to pay $100 a month for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Walnut\u2019s two biggest customer groups are the uninsured (people who have lost their jobs from COVID-19), and consumers who have high deductible plans.<\/p>\n<p>Walnut isn\u2019t the first. PrimaHealth Credit, Walnut\u2019s closest competitor, offers<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/04\/primahealth-credit-offers-a-buy-now-pay-later-lending-service-for-elective-procedures\/\"> point-of-sale lending procedures <\/a>for elective medical procedures. Think surgeries like cataract work or dental work. The company said the service is currently available in Arizona, California, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas, and will be expanded to all 50 states this year. Walnut, comparatively, is mostly focused on the East Coast and plans to expand nationwide by the end of this year.<\/p>\n<p>PrimaHealth\u2019s average loan size is $1,800, and Walnut\u2019s average loan size is $5,000.<\/p>\n<p>The company is currently piloting with a handful of healthcare providers in dermatology, dentistry and fertility. It has had more than 500 patient loan applications, totaling over $4.6 million in application volume year-to-date. Patel says that Walnut only accepted a fraction of these applications, but declined to share what percent of money it has lent so far. As Walnut refines its model, it might be able to cover other categories.<\/p>\n<p>Up until this point, Walnut has been lending off of its own balance sheet. In order to truly scale, it will need to get a new source of capital &#8212; either a credit line, debt financing round or venture capital &#8212; to offer more loans. Patel says that the startup is in talks with banks, and turned down a debt offer due to size and rate.<\/p>\n<p>Venture capital seems to be the solution for now: The startup announced that it has raised a $3.6 million seed round from investors including Gradient Ventures, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Supernode Ventures, TA Ventures, Polymath Capital, Tack Ventures, Awesome People Ventures, Newark Ventures and NKM Capital. Angels include the CEOs of Giphy and PillPack, and the CTO of Rampm Financial as well as an NFL coach.

with e-commerce platform Shopify. The deal aims to make it easier for Shopify&#8217;s over 1 million merchants to reach TikTok&#8217;s younger audience and drive sales. The partnership will eventually expand to include other in-app shopping features, as well, the companies said.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, the agreement allows Shopify merchants to create, run and optimize their TikTok marketing campaigns directly from the Shopify dashboard by installing the new TikTok channel app from the Shopify App Store. Once installed, merchants will have access to the key functions from the TikTok For Business Ads Manager at their disposal.<\/p>\n<p>These ad tools allow merchants to create native, shareable content that turns their products into In-Feed video ads that will resonate with the TikTok community. Merchants will be able to target their audiences across gender, age, user behavior, and video category, and then track the campaign&#8217;s performance over time. The campaigns&#8217; costs will vary, based on the merchant&#8217;s own business objectives and how much they want to spend.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As a part of this effort, Shopify merchants can also install or connect their &#8220;TikTok Pixel&#8221; &#8212; a tool that helps them to more easily track conversions driven by their TikTok ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, e-commerce merchants <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article?aid=94409979840183423\">can track user actions like<\/a> a user browsing their page, a registration on a website, adding items to their cart, placing an order, and completing the payment.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2065894\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2065894\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2065894\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=768,497 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=680,440 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok1.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2065894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Shopify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Shopify tells TechCrunch a small number of merchants previously gained access to these features as part of a beta test. But as of today, Oct. 27, the product is being made available to all merchants across the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;TikTok is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing entertainment platforms with over 100 million highly engaged users in the U.S. alone,&#8221; said Satish Kanwar, Vice President of Product at Shopify, in a statement about the new partnership. &#8220;The TikTok channel means Shopify merchants\u2014even those without a strong TikTok following of their own yet\u2014can connect with these new audiences using content that feels authentic and genuine to the TikTok experience,&#8221; Kanwar added.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2065893\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2065893\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2065893\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=150,97 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=300,194 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=768,497 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=680,440 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok2.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2065893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Shopify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>To get started with the new features, merchants who want to advertise on TikTok will first install the TikTok channel app, then create and connect their TikTok For Business account and install the one-click pixel. They can then deploy In-Feed shoppable video ads by selecting the product they want to feature using ad templates specifically designed for commerce. Because these templates use existing imagery or videos, the TikTok channel can work for merchants of any size, Shopify notes.<\/p>\n<p>To kick off the partnership, merchants are being offered a $300 ad credit to get started with their first TikTok campaign.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the two companies have partnered on their first co-branded <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/19\/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app\/\">Hashtag Challenge Plus<\/a> campaign, #ShopBlack, to celebrate Black-owned businesses. Shopify had earlier featured Black-owned businesses in its own app, Shop. But from Nov. 10 through Nov. 15, the TikTok community will be able to browse videos from over 40 Shopify merchants via the new hashtag and its accompanying branded effect within TikTok, too.<\/p>\n<p>Shopify and TikTok had been working together to test various social commerce initiatives ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p>The companies, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/tiktok-users-can-link-to-shopify-storefronts-with-ecommerce-buttons-2020-9\">had been spotted trialing a new shopping button<\/a> that allowed TikTok creators to link their Shopify storefront from their videos. (Teespring was also testing this with TikTok). TikTok had offered <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article?aid=6723856280470945797\">a TikTok Ads Pixel<\/a> for Shopify merchants before today, as well.\u00a0 But the partnership makes the pixel integration a 1-click install, so merchants don&#8217;t have to manipulate code.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2065892\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2065892\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2065892\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ShopifyxTikTok3.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"440\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2065892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Shopify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are delighted to partner with Shopify and provide a channel for their merchants to reach new audiences and drive sales on TikTok,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, Vice President, Global Business Solutions at TikTok, in a statement. &#8220;As social commerce proliferates, retailers are recognizing that TikTok&#8217;s creative and highly engaged community sets it apart from other platforms. We&#8217;re constantly exploring new and innovative ways to connect brands with our users, and Shopify is the perfect partner to help us grow and expand our commerce capabilities globally,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok and Shopify&#8217;s partnership won&#8217;t be limited to the new TikTok channel app, however. That&#8217;s just the first step.<\/p>\n<p>We understand the deal will soon expand to other shopping features, too.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok says it plans to start testing new in-app features that will make it easier for users to discover Shopify merchants and their products by expanding their reach through video and on their account profiles. These features will also &#8220;let users browse merchant&#8217;s products and shop directly through the TikTok app,&#8221; a spokesperson said. They didn&#8217;t offer specific details about the features or how the payments portion would work, saying that more information would be available when the new tools launched.<\/p>\n<p>However, the features will launch to a limited beta group of testers soon, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2065906\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2065906\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2065906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png 2320w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=150,65 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=300,129 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=768,331 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=680,293 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=1536,662 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=2048,883 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Shopify_TikTokCreative1.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2065906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Shopify isn&#8217;t the first to recognize TikTok&#8217;s potential as a new type of social shopping platform.
