src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OWB7-1.png"></div><div class="blog-section_inner_bottom"><p><span style="font-weight:400">The beauty industry is constantly changing, with more representation and avant-garde looks than ever before, redefining our perception of conventional makeup and beauty. Long are the days that makeup could only be sold through catalogues or department stores. Now, most beauty brands have direct-to-consumer business strategies and advertise their products on social media. However, the beauty market is an endlessly crowded one, which makes it difficult to navigate for many brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">This is why in recent years, many fashion and beauty brands have invested their digital spending in influencer marketing.  Even though cosmetic companies are the most likely to hire beauty influencers to partner or represent their brands, other industries can benefit from working with beauty and makeup influencers by reaching a new audience who often turn to these influencers for guidance and recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">This works particularly well if your brand overlaps with the beauty industry, which can mean fashion, lifestyle, jewellery or other accessories. Even tech brands like </span><a href="../../pulse/4-brands-killing-influencer-marketing-tiffany-everett/index.htm"><span style="font-weight:400">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> have partnered with beauty influencers, as their platform has a strong base for engaging and consistent content. Beauty influencers also have become big activists and advocates in recent years, representing more personalised characteristics that people identify with on social media. For some brands, it may be valuable to work with beauty and makeup influencers for no other reason than they share similar messaging or values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">The desire that society has formed to impose more realistic beauty standards has also evolved into a social media strategy tool for beauty brands, specifically when it comes to UGC (user-generated content). The beauty industry has seen major shifts, from over the counter glossy makeup professionals to barefaced, authentic influencers who teach people how to use makeup to feel flawless in their own skin. Makeup in 2020 is more advanced than it has ever been. Makeup means skincare, serums, nutrients, transparent glosses, false eyelashes and so much more. Therefore, the makeup marketplace has just spiralled out of control. Forbes reported that </span><a href="../../sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2019/12/13/how-influencers-are-making-over-beauty-marketing/index.htm#7f84b3dc1203"><span style="font-weight:400">62 percent of women</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> said that they follow beauty influencers on social media platforms.</span></p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>How fashion brands use influencers</strong></h2>
<p class="" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Since social media platforms have cracked down on advertising, lots of fashion and beauty brands have struggled to come up with strategies that help their business grow organically. According to <a href="../../en/marketing/research/all-research.html">L2’s</a> fashion video report, fashion brands are particularly struggling to engage customers with social media videos, without promoting them as advertisements. According to the report, even storytelling videos struggled to perform well – and most views don’t come from organic searches, but paid advertisement clicks.</p>
<p class="">This need for organic and engaging content across the industry has widened the need for influencer marketing campaigns. Influencer marketing strategies have become a worthy investment for many brands across fashion and beauty. For beauty especially, influencer marketing on YouTube has performed well, as viewers are more drawn to the authentic feel of influencer’s content over paid advertisements.</p>
<p class="">Influencers have allowed beauty brands to reach customers in nontraditional ways that go beyond purchasing. This includes amplifying brand values, image and messaging when it comes to creating organic content. Since influencers have the power to form genuine relationships with consumers, there is a leverage for brands to understand what customers want, and how to provide that to them.</p>
<p class="">According to launchmetrics, In beauty, influencer marketing alone was the largest contributor to media impact value with 55% of buzz and value coming from influencers. YouTube has worked wonders for fashion and beauty brands, driving almost 20% of global media impact value. A good example of this is the collaboration between Morphe Cosmetics and James Charles, which generated $45.8M from his Youtube channel of 30M viewers.</p>
<p class="">For fashion and beauty brands to compete in the crowded social media landscape that’s currently present, it’s obvious that they need influencers to maintain relationships with their customers in the long-run to see real ROI.</p>
<p class="">There’s a reason that traditional word of mouth marketing has stuck around for so long – and that’s because it works. Popular beauty brand <a href="../a-simple-guide-on-how-social-media-marketing-can-be-used-to-grow-a-small-business-case-study-included.html">Glossier is the perfect example</a> of this, it launched a referral scheme that each had a personal link to the consumer, so it was easy to keep track of where sales were coming from… and how. Glossier is the perfect example of how big a small brand can grow, thanks to social media. The beauty brand proves that there is huge power in cult-following and that you can’t create social media hype without one. Peer to peer recommendations is not outdated, just hard to identify when it comes to social media marketing.</p>

Long are the days that makeup could only be sold through catalogues or department stores. Now, most beauty brands have direct-to-consumer business strategies and advertise their products on social media. However, the beauty market is an endlessly crowded one, which makes it difficult to navigate for many brands. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis is why in recent years, many fashion and beauty brands have invested their digital spending in influencer marketing.  Even though cosmetic companies are the most likely to hire beauty influencers to partner or represent their brands, other industries can benefit from working with beauty and makeup influencers by reaching a new audience who often turn to these influencers for guidance and recommendations. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis works particularly well if your brand overlaps with the beauty industry, which can mean fashion, lifestyle, jewellery or other accessories.

Beauty influencers also have become big activists and advocates in recent years, representing more personalised characteristics that people identify with on social media. For some brands, it may be valuable to work with beauty and makeup influencers for no other reason than they share similar messaging or values. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe desire that society has formed to impose more realistic beauty standards has also evolved into a social media strategy tool for beauty brands, specifically when it comes to UGC (user-generated content). The beauty industry has seen major shifts, from over the counter glossy makeup professionals to barefaced, authentic influencers who teach people how to use makeup to feel flawless in their own skin. Makeup in 2020 is more advanced than it has ever been. Makeup means skincare, serums, nutrients, transparent glosses, false eyelashes and so much more. Therefore, the makeup marketplace has just spiralled out of control.

According to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/all-research\"\u003eL2’s\u003c/a\u003e fashion video report, fashion brands are particularly struggling to engage customers with social media videos, without promoting them as advertisements.

Influencer marketing strategies have become a worthy investment for many brands across fashion and beauty.
