src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NWB2-6.png"></div><div class="blog-section_inner_bottom"><p><span style="font-weight:400">Influencer Marketing is one of the most important forms of digital marketing. It’s safe to say that it is more than a trend or a buzzword, but the most modern form of marketing, however, it is still so misunderstood.  </span></p>
<p><strong>What is Influencer Marketing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Influencer marketing is a new wave of digital marketing that uses traditional word-of-mouth techniques through social media content. This can mean celebrity endorsements on social media or curated content campaigns. The reason why influencer marketing is so impactful is because it builds relationships between brands and influencers that are organic and authentic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">This means that their audience is authentic which means that their followers will have genuine interest in what they post. Whether you use influencer marketing services to boost your sales or grow your audience’s perception, the world of influencer marketing is continuing to change and become more complex, making it difficult to keep up to date for the industry and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">The one prediction we can confidently make about <a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing.html">i</a></span>nfluencer marketing services<span style="font-weight:400"> is that they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. Social media is more than a form of communication, but a network that connects anyone who is a consumer. This is why influencer marketing will always create new opportunities for any industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Partnering with influencers and building a social media campaign can formulate a variety of results, which is why it is important to take time in picking the right influencer to represent your brand. For any brand that’s thinking of using social media marketing, it is important to build brand awareness. Once you are present on social media, your key objective may be to build a stronger audience or engagement, which is why we offer unique influencer marketing services that cater to your specific business needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">If you are curating a specific campaign with a message that’s focused on advocacy or trending conversation, you may consider focusing on building a strong and loyal with your customers. Outlining your objectives is the first step in creating a social media strategy. This will help you understand which data you need to collect and which results you should assess. This could range from working with micro-influencers or other relationships that have had the greatest success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">In order to plan the right strategy, it is key to be as precise as possible. This begins with understanding who your target audience is, and thinking of the best ways they will engage with your content. Usually, the best engagement comes organically which is why it is crucial to spend time thinking of the behaviours your target audience will have. We are just as driven by results as your business is, which is why we are meticulous about the influencers who we work with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Having the opportunity to combine celebrity endorsement with social media and the global marketplace is what makes influencer marketing so effective. Influencer marketing fuses traditional marketing concepts with new digital ideas. Another key factor to influencer marketing is focusing on building strong relationships between the chosen influencer and client.</span></p>
<p><strong>How your business can benefit from Influencer Marketing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Influencer marketing is a priority to most brands that use social media because it provides endless benefits such as: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Reaching a bigger and new audience </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Builds trust between your brand and customers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Grows your social followings </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Increases your pages’ traffic </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">New leads for collaboration and sales </span></li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2680 size-full" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NWB1-6.png" alt="Influencer Marketing" width="625" height="407" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NWB1-6-1.png 625w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NWB1-6-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">There’s no deep science behind influencer marketing. If a celebrity or someone of influence who you admire is wearing or using a product, you are more likely to be interested in it. Influencers have hundreds to thousands of followers across all different social media platforms like <a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/instagram-marketing-agency.html">Instagram</a>, <a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/snapchat-marketing-agency.html">Snapchat</a>, <a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/tiktok-marketing-agency.html">TikTok</a> or Youtube. These people have professionally built an audience who they engage with, hence the name ‘influencers’. Building a social media following is not easy. This is why platforms like YouTube and Facebook pay influencers lots of money, because an organic audience is very valuable. </span></p>
<p><strong>How to start using influencer marketing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Once you find an influencer you want to work with, it makes the most sense to pay them directly for sponsored posts. For example, if their main platform is Instagram, think of how you can display your brand in a grid post for the influencer to upload on their own feed. This kind of ‘word-of-mouth’ marketing is not specific to large companies. Any size business can benefit from influencer marketing. You don’t necessarily need to choose influencers who have millions of followers. On average, influencers get paid hundreds to thousands of dollars to post. Sometimes, micro-influencers are more successful.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is a micro-influencer?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">It’s safe to say that influencer marketing isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Since the world of influencer marketing has become so oversaturated, it is not always a clear process to define success. Sometimes if an influencer has hundreds-of-thousands of followers, they are deemed a celebrity which isn’t as easy to relate to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Being influenced to buy something online is a lot easier when we trust the opinion of the seller, for example, we are more likely to trust our friends than a celebrity we know we cannot relate to. This has created a unique space in the market for influencers who have a smaller following, which is more relatable. These influencers are called micro-influencers. Micro-influencers are people who can be relatable through their ‘everyday life’ content. Usually they have a following that isn’t based on high numbers but is subjected to a particular niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"> What makes micro-influencers so useful when it comes to digital marketing is that they are relatable. It is a modern way of word-of-mouth marketing that has no limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Micro-influencers can have fewer than 10,000 followers on all different platforms from Instagram to <a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/facebook-marketing-agency.html">Facebook</a> or <a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/youtube-marketing-agency.html">YouTube</a>. The versatility that comes with Influencer marketing is what makes it a perfect foundation for many direct-to-consumer social media strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Studies even show that merely </span><a href="../../news/survey-finds-consumers-crave-authenticity-and-user-generated-content-deli/511360/index.htm"><span style="font-weight:400">70% of millennials</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> are influenced by their peers when it comes to consuming. Another bonus about micro-influencers is that there are so many of them, which means endless opportunities for any industry. This will help you define your niche and identify your community.</span></p>
<p><strong>Here are the specific steps we recommend when trying to find the right micro-influencers:</strong></p>
<p><b>1. Outline key marketing objectives</b></p>
<p>Outlining your key <span style="font-weight:400">marketing objectives is always the first and most important step to influencer marketing. A social media campaign can have endless results, so it’s more important to focus on the kind of influencer that is spearheading your campaign. Decide on whether or not the most important objective is sales or brand awareness, or maybe it’s building awareness about a particular trending topic.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><b>Visualize the campaign you’d like to run </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Next, it is important to decide on which type of campaign you want to run to find the kind of micro-influencers you want to work with. Here are different types of social media campaigns: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Gifting: giving influencers gifts in exchange for branded content </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Sponsored content: hiring an influencer to curate your branded content </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Giveaways: coming up with a unique incentive that will mention your branded content and gain followers who are interested in getting involved </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Takeovers: Guest posting and allowing an influencer to run or write for your social media channels </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Discount codes: giving away discount codes through influencer marketing to build brand awareness and audience </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Affiliate marketing: using different affiliate codes to get followers involved in your brand, through an influencer who can earn money each time someone buys though their platform </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Brand ambassadors: deciding on a partnership with an particular influencer who will promote your products or brand regularly in exchange for certain perks</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Know your niche </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Knowing your niche means knowing what is being said about it. This is why we recommend setting up a new alert (can be on google) for any industry related news, to see who is already talking about your niche.  Researching online forums and different tags will also help you find people who are already posting about your industry. It’s a good idea to start with popular accounts in your industry when thinking of building brand awareness since they have the biggest audience. </span>Seeing how your competitors are approaching micro-influencer marketing<span style="font-weight:400"> can also help lead to finding the right accounts to monitor or reach-out to. If there’s an influencer who is already interested in your competitor, the chances that they will be interested in your brand are higher.</span></p>
<p><b>4. See who your audience is already following </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">The right influencers don’t necessarily have to be tied to your industry. Networking with influencers within industries that overlap yours will help your brand reach a whole new audience. Building a SWOT or target analysis is another great way to see who is saying what about your niche, and understand your audience’s needs. It’s also important to look and keep track of other sites that your audience is visiting to develop your own data and research, which will help build your own reach and find new influencers in and outside of your niche. This could create a new opportunity to find a digital space that your competitors might not be present in yet.</span></p>
<p><strong>5. Use hashtags and keyword searches</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Exploring your own hashtags or keywords is also crucial because most social media platforms have their own search engine. You never know who may come across your page, simply by using any hashtag on your profile that relates to your brand’s messaging. This could lead to new customers or influencers looking to work with your brand. Create a list of keywords that coincide with your brand, and monitor them routinely. Make sure the list of keywords is specific and another useful tip is to go through the posts that have the highest engagement and see what king of discussions are already going on within your niche.</span></p>
<p><strong>Influencer Agencies and Micro-Influencers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Influener marketing agencies use </span><a href="../../uk/services/influencer-marketing/topics/micro-influencers.html">micro-influencing services</a><span style="font-weight:400"> to curate effective social media campaigns. We at Socially Powerful use strategies catered to your brand that are not a part of any third-party talent, to ensure that our success is authentic and based on metrics and data. We also combine different </span><a href="../../uk/services/social-media-agency.html">social media marketing services</a><span style="font-weight:400"> to form an effective and successful digital marketing campaign. . Community managing services are also very beneficial when it comes to monitoring and curating micro-influencer campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Micro-influencers are an effective approach to social media marketing that guarantees results. Organic content is much more likely to be engaged with by audiences than commercial content, it fits into feeds more effortlessly. ‘Real-life’ situations make for better selling opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Most importantly, influencer marketing can be successful for a brand of any size, and any budget. Whether you are looking for top celebrity endorsements or micro-influencing, influencer marketing can speak to any audience and grow any business online.</span></p>

This can mean celebrity endorsements on social media or curated content campaigns. The reason why influencer marketing is so impactful is because it builds relationships between brands and influencers that are organic and authentic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis means that their audience is authentic which means that their followers will have genuine interest in what they post.

This is why influencer marketing will always create new opportunities for any industry. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePartnering with influencers and building a social media campaign can formulate a variety of results, which is why it is important to take time in picking the right influencer to represent your brand. For any brand that’s thinking of using social media marketing, it is important to build brand awareness. Once you are present on social media, your key objective may be to build a stronger audience or engagement, which is why we offer unique influencer marketing services that cater to your specific business needs. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIf you are curating a specific campaign with a message that’s focused on advocacy or trending conversation, you may consider focusing on building a strong and loyal with your customers. Outlining your objectives is the first step in creating a social media strategy. This will help you understand which data you need to collect and which results you should assess. This could range from working with micro-influencers or other relationships that have had the greatest success. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn order to plan the right strategy, it is key to be as precise as possible. This begins with understanding who your target audience is, and thinking of the best ways they will engage with your content. Usually, the best engagement comes organically which is why it is crucial to spend time thinking of the behaviours your target audience will have. We are just as driven by results as your business is, which is why we are meticulous about the influencers who we work with. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eHaving the opportunity to combine celebrity endorsement with social media and the global marketplace is what makes influencer marketing so effective.

If a celebrity or someone of influence who you admire is wearing or using a product, you are more likely to be interested in it. Influencers have hundreds to thousands of followers across all different social media platforms like \u003ca href=\"https://sociallypowerful.com/uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/instagram-marketing-agency\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://sociallypowerful.com/uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/snapchat-marketing-agency\"\u003eSnapchat\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://sociallypowerful.com/uk/services/influencer-marketing/channels/tiktok-marketing-agency\"\u003eTikTok\u003c/a\u003e or Youtube. These people have professionally built an audience who they engage with, hence the name ‘influencers’. Building a social media following is not easy. This is why platforms like YouTube and Facebook pay influencers lots of money, because an organic audience is very valuable. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to start using influencer marketing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOnce you find an influencer you want to work with, it makes the most sense to pay them directly for sponsored posts. For example, if their main platform is Instagram, think of how you can display your brand in a grid post for the influencer to upload on their own feed. This kind of ‘word-of-mouth’ marketing is not specific to large companies. Any size business can benefit from influencer marketing. You don’t necessarily need to choose influencers who have millions of followers. On average, influencers get paid hundreds to thousands of dollars to post. Sometimes, micro-influencers are more successful.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a micro-influencer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIt’s safe to say that influencer marketing isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Since the world of influencer marketing has become so oversaturated, it is not always a clear process to define success. Sometimes if an influencer has hundreds-of-thousands of followers, they are deemed a celebrity which isn’t as easy to relate to. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBeing influenced to buy something online is a lot easier when we trust the opinion of the seller, for example, we are more likely to trust our friends than a celebrity we know we cannot relate to. This has created a unique space in the market for influencers who have a smaller following, which is more relatable. These influencers are called micro-influencers. Micro-influencers are people who can be relatable through their ‘everyday life’ content. Usually they have a following that isn’t based on high numbers but is subjected to a particular niche. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e What makes micro-influencers so useful when it comes to digital marketing is that they are relatable.

Networking with influencers within industries that overlap yours will help your brand reach a whole new audience.

It’s also important to look and keep track of other sites that your audience is visiting to develop your own data and research, which will help build your own reach and find new influencers in and outside of your niche. This could create a new opportunity to find a digital space that your competitors might not be present in yet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.
